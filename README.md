# Harry Potter IFD Milestone Project
Interactive Frontend Milestone Project - Harry Potter

As a big fan of Harry Potter, I wanted to create a website for fans that is fun.
On my website you can click on the HAT and you will be randomly sorted into one of the four houses Griffendor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin.
The background changes to the respective coat of arms of the house and the house information appears below the HAT.
All your house mates are listed and you can find out who is in Dumbledors Army or who in this house is a Deatheater.
In the bottom section you can choose a spell to find out what kind of spell it is and what it does.

### User Story

2. The user needs to able to let the hat get a random house. -sorting a student into a house
3. The user needs to be able to see the house mates according to the random selected house.
4. The background should change colour according to the selected house.
5. The user needs to be able to find information about who is in Dumbledors Army.
